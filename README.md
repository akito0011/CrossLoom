# CrossLoom

CrossLoom is an application developed during the month-long "Apple Foundation" workshop at the University of Palermo.

## About the App

The main goal of CrossLoom is to help gamers manage their entire game library in a single, centralized location. Games are automatically imported by connecting the user's account from the corresponding gaming platforms using available APIs.

## Features

- **Centralized Game Library**: Automatically sync and display all your games from various platforms.
- **Personalized Game Recommendations**: Get game suggestions tailored to your preferences and gaming habits thanks to an AI model developed using CoreML and a dataset found on Kaggle.
- **Apple-Inspired Design**: Minimalistic and modern UI, combining Apple design principles with subtle Material Design elements.
