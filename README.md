**CrossLoom** is a multi-platform game library and recommendation app developed as part of the **Apple Foundation Program @ UniPa (June–July 2025)**.  
The app allows users to authenticate with gaming services (currently **Steam**) and access their game libraries in real time, while receiving personalized game recommendations based on their play and rating history.

## Features

- 🔐 **Verified OAuth2 Authentication** via Steam  
- 🎮 **Real-time game library access** using official Steam Web API  
- 📈 **Personalized game suggestions** using a trained ML recommendation model  
- ☁️ **Serverless backend** deployed on Vercel for secure REST API interactions  
- 📱 Native iOS interface with SwiftUI  
- 📊 Precision at K metrics up to 100% on top-3 predictions

## Tech Stack

### iOS App
- **Language**: Swift  
- **Framework**: SwiftUI  
- **Architecture**: MVVM  
- **Networking**: URLSession + custom REST calls  
- **ML Integration**: CoreML / CreateML model  

### Backend
- **Platform**: Vercel (Serverless)  
- **Language**: JavaScript / Node.js  
- **Auth**: Steam OAuth2 flow  
- **Endpoints**: REST API for fetching user libraries and profile via SteamID  

---

## Authentication Flow

1. The user logs in via Steam OAuth (handled through a Vercel-hosted serverless backend)

2. Once authenticated, their **public SteamID** is retrieved.

3. The app uses that ID to make direct calls to the **Steam Web API** and fetch:
   - Owned games
   - Playtime stats
   - Game metadata

## ML Recommendation System

We developed a recommendation model using **CreateML** with **Collaborative Filtering** on real Steam user data.  
The dataset was split 80/20 (train/test) and trained across **307 game classes**.  
It recommends games based on a user’s past ratings (1–5) and generates `K` suggestions.

 **Model Precision at K**:

| K | Precision |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | 100%      |
| 2 | 100%      |
| 3 | 100%      |
| 4 | 92%       |
| 5 | 87%       |

 **Model built and tested in Swift with CreateML, then exported as a CoreML model for local prediction.**
